## Allowed mesh formats
LCMsim_v2.jl does not include mesh generation. A 3-node triangular shell mesh with the pre-defined regions must be generated with a meshing tool before starting the filling simulation. The authors used Altair HyperWorks but also free software tools such as SALOME-MECA, GMSH or NETGEN can be used.

The shell mesh is created on the part's mid-surface. Mid-surface models are often available in composite manufacturing since computational stress analysis for thin-walled parts is performed on the partâ€™s mid-surface too.

Currently it is possible to use meshes generated by:
- Altair HyperMesh, with set definitions (.hm)
- Gmsh, with physical part ids (.bdf)
- Abaqus, with Element Sets (.inp)
